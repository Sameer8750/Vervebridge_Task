# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment Using IoT Data.



## 📊 Dataset Overview:

The Predictive Maintenance project focuses on using IoT data to monitor industrial equipment performance and predict when maintenance is needed. The dataset includes information on temperature, vibration, pressure, RPM, and an indicator of maintenance requirements, along with calculated metrics such as changes in temperature and vibration over time.

## Key Features of the Dataset:

- Timestamp: Time of the sensor reading.
- Temperature (°C): Temperature data in Celsius.
- Vibration (mm/s): Vibration data in millimeters per second.
- Pressure (Pa): Pressure data in Pascals.
- RPM: Revolutions per minute.
- Maintenance Required: A binary column indicating whether maintenance is required (1) or not (0).
- Temp_Change: Change in temperature since the previous reading.
- Vib_Change: Change in vibration since the previous reading.
- Temperature_Mean: Average temperature recorded up to the current timestamp.
- Vibration_Mean: Average vibration recorded up to the current timestamp.
- Pressure_Mean: Average pressure recorded up to the current timestamp.
- RPM_Mean: Average RPM recorded up to the current timestamp.
